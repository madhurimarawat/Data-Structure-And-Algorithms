# Mean

The mean, or average, is a measure of central tendency that summarizes a set of values by identifying the central point of the distribution.

### Mean Formula

For a dataset with $n$ values ${x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n}$, the mean $ \bar{x}$ is calculated as:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$

Where:

- $x_i$ represents each individual value in the dataset.
- $n$ is the total number of values.

### Explanation

- **Arithmetic Mean**: Sum of all values divided by the number of values.
- **Weighted Mean**: When values contribute unequally, calculated using weights for each value.

### Example

For a dataset with values ${4, 8, 6, 5, 7}$:

The mean $\bar{x}$ is:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{5} (4 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 7) = \frac{30}{5} = 6
$$

This indicates that the average value of the dataset is 6.

## Challenge

Create a program to find mean of any values.
