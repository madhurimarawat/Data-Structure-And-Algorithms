# CodeMatics: University Statistics Contest Solutions

This repository contains the solutions to various statistics problems that I solved for a contest organized by my university club. The questions and their descriptions were sourced from official repositories, and I added the solutions myself.

## Repository Link

You can access the repository here: [CodeMatics on GitHub](https://github.com/Programmers-Paradise/CodeMatics)

## Contents

This repository includes solutions to the following statistical concepts:

- **Bayes' Theorem**: Calculation of posterior probability using prior and likelihood.
- **Correlation**: Understanding the relationship between two variables with the Pearson correlation coefficient.
- **Mean**: Calculation of the mean for a given set of values.

Each solution is implemented in C and includes comments for clarity and ease of understanding.

Here's how to improve your usage instructions for clarity and ease of understanding:

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Programmers-Paradise/CodeMatics.git
   ```

2. **Program Directory**:  
   Navigate to the directory containing the C programs related to the statistics questions using the following command:

  ```sh
  cd "C Programs\Statistics Questions"
  ```

3. **Compile and Run**:

   - To compile each C program, use a C compiler like `gcc`. Replace `program_name.c` with the actual program file's name:

   ```sh
   gcc -o output_file "C Programs\Statistics Questions\program_name.c"
   ```

   - After compiling, run the compiled program by using:

   ```sh
   ./output_file
   ```

4. **Precompiled Output Files**:
   - Precompiled output files are already provided, you can run them directly in the command prompt:
   ```sh
   ./output_file
   ```
   - Simply navigate to the directory where the output file is located and execute the command above.
